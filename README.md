## E-Commerce Product Analytics – Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior and purchase patterns on an e-commerce platform using event-level data. The goal is to understand funnel drop-offs, price sensitivity, high-value users, time-based trends, and revenue concentration across products and brands.

## Problem

The platform showed weak purchase conversion (6.2%) with an 84% drop from view → cart and no clear understanding of key revenue drivers or high-value users.

## Approach

Analyzed 12.4M+ user events using Python to study:

 - Funnel performance

 - Category & brand conversion

 - Price sensitivity

 - Session behavior

 - Day & hour-based purchase trends

 - Power-user contribution

 - Pareto revenue distribution

All insights were compiled into a PPT for presentation.

## Key Results

 - Top 10% users drive 43.8% of total revenue.

 - 5 brands (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Huawei) contribute nearly 80% of total revenue.

 - Peak purchase activity occurs during weekends and morning hours.

 - Major drop-off identified at the view → cart stage.

## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy
Used for feature extraction, funnel analysis, user segmentation, pricing insights, and Pareto analysis.
